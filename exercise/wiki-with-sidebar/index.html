                            The Sims is a series of life simulation video games 
                            developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. 
                            The franchise has sold nearly 200 million copies 
                            worldwide, and is one of the best-selling video game 
                            series of all time. It is also part of the larger Sim 
                            series, started by SimCity in 1989.
                            The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, 
                            in that they lack any defined goals (except for some 
                            later expansion packs and console versions which 
                            introduced this gameplay style). The player creates
                            virtual people called "Sims", places them in houses, 
                            and helps direct their moods and satisfy their 
                            desires. Players can either place their Sims 
                            in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. 
                            Each successive expansion pack and game in the 
                            series augmented what the player could do with 
                            their Sims

                                Electronic Arts announced The Sims 4 on May 6, 
                                2013. The announcement stated that the game was 
                                in development by Maxis. The Sims 4 takes place in 
                                an alternative setting/timeline from the game's
                                previous installments. Later in 2014, further 
                                details on features and gameplay were announced. 
                                The release date of September 2, 2014, was 
                                announced at E3 2014. As of December 2023, 
                                fifteen "expansion packs", twelve "game packs", 
                                nineteen "stuff packs", and twenty-five "kits" 
                                have been released, and updates have added content 
                                that was previously absent, such as basements, 
                                ghosts, pools, modular stairs, toddlers, new careers, 
                                terrain tools, additional skin tones, bunk beds and 
                                infants. The Sims 4 was made free-to-play on 
                                October 18, 2022.
