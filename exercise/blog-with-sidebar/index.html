                        In short, the final season has a total of 29 episodes. 
                        The award-winning manga ended back in 2021, and the anime 
                        adaptation is most likely releasing the finale in a 3 part 
                        special because there are only 5 more chapters left, 
                        which isn't enough material for a full season. Rather 
                        than deviating from the source material and giving fans 
                        an underwhelming goodbye, the writers have chosen to 
                        comit to its original ending.

                        The coalition forces between Marley and Paradis will 
                        try to put some sense into Eren, but it seems that he's 
                        far from being redeemed and reachable in his Titan form. 
                        He has already told his friends he won't take away 
                        their free will. Fan-favorite characters like Hange 
                        and Floch have already bit the dust in the Special 
                        1 episode, and considering that AoT doesn't even 
                        flinch killing off likable characters, the fandom 
                        might be in one heck of a heartbreak.
                    </P>
